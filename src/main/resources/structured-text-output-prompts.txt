Your task is to process the input text (in one sentence per line format), identify architecturally relevant software architecture components, and output structured data about their mentions.

Instructions:
1. Component identification:
Identify all architecturally relevant software architecture components that are explicitly named in the text (direct mentions).
For each, determine the most descriptive name.
2. Line-by-line analysis:
For each line in the text (starting from 1):
Every time a previously identified component is mentioned, output: "<componentName>, <lineNumber>, <referenceType>"
componentName: The most descriptive name of the component (consistent across all lines).
lineNumber: Line number where the reference occurs.
referenceType: either "DIRECT" or "INDIRECT".
DIRECT -> The name or any alternative name of the component appears in the text (case-insensitive).
INDIRECT -> The component is referenced indirectly (e.g., via pronouns like "it", or via "this module").
3. Alternative names:
After analyzing all lines, list alternative or ambiguous names for each component in this format: "<componentName>: <alternativeName1>, <alternativeName2>, ..."
(If there are no alternatives for a component, write "None".)
4. Final consistency check:
Verify that:
All line numbers are accurate.
All alternative names are correctly listed.
DIRECT is used only when the component name or an alternative name appears in the line.

Formatting:
Return results in structured plain text as follows:
<componentName>, <lineNumber>, <referenceType>
...
Alternative names:
<componentName>: <alternativeName1>, <alternativeName2>, ...
...

Example:
Text:
The AuthenticationService handles login requests.
It forwards valid credentials to the UserDatabase.
The service logs each attempt.

Output:
AuthenticationService, 1, DIRECT
AuthenticationService, 2, INDIRECT
UserDatabase, 2, DIRECT
AuthenticationService, 3, INDIRECT

Alternative names:
AuthenticationService: service
UserDatabase: None


Use this exact output format and do not add anything else!

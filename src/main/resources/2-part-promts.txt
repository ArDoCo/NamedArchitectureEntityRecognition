In the following text, which architecturally relevant components are directly named?
For each component, provide its name and all alternative names and the line numbers where it appears.
Also disclose for each line number of an appearance if the appearance is a direct or an indirect appearance.
DIRECT -> The name or any alternative name of the component appears in the text (case-insensitive).
INDIRECT -> The component is referenced indirectly (e.g., via pronouns like "it", or via "this component").

DIRECT -> The name or any alternative name of the component appears in the text (case-insensitive).
INDIRECT -> The component is referenced indirectly (e.g., via pronouns like "it", or via "this component").
Be careful to only name real components and no interfaces or external libraries etc.

1:------------
In the following text, identify all architecturally relevant components that are explicitly named.

For each such component:
1. Provide:
- The primary name (as it appears in the text)
- All alternative names or abbreviations found in the text (case-insensitive match)

2. For each appearance:
- The line number (start counting from 1)
- Whether the appearance is:
    DIRECT = The name or any alternative name of the component appears literally in the text (case-insensitive)
    or
    INDIRECT = The component is referred to indirectly, e.g., by pronouns ("it", "this component", "such module")

Rules:
- Only include actual architecturally relevant components (e.g., modules, services, subsystems, layers)
- Do not include: interfaces, external libraries, frameworks, or technologies unless they are implemented in this architecture as components

Return your findings in a clear, unambiguous, structured text format so that a follow-up transformation into JSON is easy.

Given the last answer (see below), for each component, output a JSON object containing:
- "name": the primary name of the component.
- "type": "COMPONENT"
- "alternativeNames": a list of alternative names.
- "occurrences": a list of objects each with:
    - "line": the line number of the occurrence (starting from 1),
    - "referenceType": "DIRECT" or "INDIRECT".

Example (for a single component):
{
    "name": "Database",
    "type": "COMPONENT"
    "alternativeNames": ["UserDatabase", "DB"],
    "occurrences": [
        {"line": 1, "referenceType": "DIRECT"},
        {"line": 3, "referenceType": "INDIRECT"},
        {"line": 8, "referenceType": "DIRECT"},
        {"line": 11, "referenceType": "INDIRECT"}
    ]
}

Output should be a JSON array, like:
[
    {
        "name": "...",
        "type": "COMPONENT",
        "alternativeNames": [...],
        "occurrences": [
            {"line": ..., "referenceType": "..."},
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]

2:------------
Given the last answer (see below), transform it into a valid JSON array.
For each component, output a JSON object containing:
{
  "name": "<primary name>",
  "type": "COMPONENT",
  "alternativeNames": ["<alt1>", "<alt2>", ...],
  "occurrences": [
    { "line": <line number>, "referenceType": "<DIRECT|INDIRECT>" },
    ...
  ]
}

Make sure:
- The JSON array is syntactically correct.
- All alternative names are inside an array (even if empty).
- All occurrences are listed with correct line numbers and "DIRECT" or "INDIRECT" as "referenceType".
- No extra text - output only the JSON array.

Example for a single component:
[
  {
    "name": "Database",
    "type": "COMPONENT",
    "alternativeNames": ["UserDatabase", "DB"],
    "occurrences": [
      { "line": 1, "referenceType": "DIRECT" },
      { "line": 3, "referenceType": "INDIRECT" },
      { "line": 8, "referenceType": "DIRECT" },
      { "line": 11, "referenceType": "INDIRECT" }
    ]
  }
]

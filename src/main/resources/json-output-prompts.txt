You are an experienced software engineer with expertise in software architecture analysis.
Given a text describing a software architecture (one sentence per line), identify all software architecture components mentioned in each sentence.

For each component, output a JSON object containing:
- "name": the primary name of the component (use the most descriptive name).
- "type": "COMPONENT"
- "alternativeNames": a list of alternative or ambiguous names, if applicable.
- "occurrences": a list of objects each with:
    - "line": the line number of the occurrence (starting from 1),
    - "referenceType": "DIRECT" or "INDIRECT".

Rules:
- Use the exact casing of the component as it appears in the text.
- Normalize similar component names if they clearly refer to the same concept (e.g., treat Database and User Database as the same component).
- Only include components that are relevant architectural elements.
- If a component appears in multiple lines, list all occurrences.
- A reference where the name or one of the alternative names is in the sentence is called DIRECT. Otherwise it is called INDIRECT.
- Only return a JSON array of component objects, nothing else.

Example (for a single component):
{
    "name": "Database",
    "type": "COMPONENT"
    "alternativeNames": ["UserDatabase", "DB"],
    "occurrences": [
        {"line": 1, "referenceType": "DIRECT"},
        {"line": 3, "referenceType": "INDIRECT"},
        {"line": 8, "referenceType": "DIRECT"},
        {"line": 11, "referenceType": "INDIRECT"}
    ]
}

Output should be a JSON array (and nothing else!), like:
[
    {
        "name": "...",
        "type": "COMPONENT",
        "alternativeNames": [...],
        "occurrences": [
            {"line": ..., "referenceType": "..."},
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]

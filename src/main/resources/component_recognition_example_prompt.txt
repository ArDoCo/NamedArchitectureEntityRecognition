Your task is to process the input text (in one sentence per line format), identify all architecturally relevant software architecture components, and output structured data about their mentions.

Instructions:
1. Component identification:
Identify all architecturally relevant software architecture components that are explicitly named in the text (direct mentions).
For each, determine the most descriptive name.
2. Line-by-line analysis:
For each line in the text (starting from 1):
Every time a component is mentioned, output: "<componentName>, <line>"
componentName: The most descriptive name of the component (consistent across all lines).
line: Text of the full line where the reference occurs.
3. Alternative names:
After analyzing all lines, list alternative or ambiguous names for each component in this format: "<componentName>: <alternativeName1>, <alternativeName2>, ..."
(If there are no alternatives for a component, write "None".)
4. Final consistency check:
Verify that:
All line references are accurate.
All alternative names are correctly listed.

Formatting:
Return results in structured plain text as follows:
BEGIN-OUTPUT
COMPONENT entities recognized:
<componentName>, '<line>'
...
Alternative names:
<componentName>: <alternativeName1>, <alternativeName2>, ...
...
END-OUTPUT

Example:
Text:
The AuthenticationService handles login requests.
It forwards valid credentials to the UserDatabase.
The service logs each attempt.

Output:
BEGIN-OUTPUT
COMPONENT entities recognized:
AuthenticationService, 'The AuthenticationService handles login requests.'
AuthenticationService, 'It forwards valid credentials to the UserDatabase.'
UserDatabase, 'It forwards valid credentials to the UserDatabase.'
AuthenticationService, 'The service logs each attempt.'

Alternative names:
AuthenticationService: service
UserDatabase: None
END-OUTPUT


Use this exact output format and do not add anything else!

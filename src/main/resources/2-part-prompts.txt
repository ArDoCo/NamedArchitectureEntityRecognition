In the following text, which architecturally relevant components are directly named?
For each component, provide its name, all alternative names, and the lines where it appears.

Be careful to only name real components and no interfaces or external libraries etc.

1:------------
In the following text, identify all architecturally relevant components that are explicitly named.

For each component, provide:
- The primary name (as it appears in the text)
- All alternative names or abbreviations found in the text (case-insensitive match)
- All complete lines where the component is mentioned.

Rules:
- Only include actual architecturally relevant components (e.g., modules, services, subsystems, layers)
- Do not include: interfaces, external libraries, frameworks, or technologies unless they are implemented in this architecture as components

Return your findings in a clear, unambiguous, structured text format so that a follow-up transformation into JSON is easy.

Given the last answer (see below), for each component, return a JSON object containing:
- "name": the primary name of the component (use the most descriptive name).
- "type": "COMPONENT"
- "alternativeNames": a list of alternative or ambiguous names, if applicable.
- "occurrences": a list of lines where the component appears or is referenced.

Output should be a JSON array (and nothing else!), like:
[
    {
        "name": "...",
        "type": "COMPONENT",
        "alternativeNames": [...],
        "occurrences": [...]
    },
    ...
]

Example:
[
    {
        "name": "AuthenticationService",
        "type": "COMPONENT",
        "alternativeNames": ["service"],
        "occurrences": ["The AuthenticationService handles login requests.", "It forwards valid credentials to the UserDatabase.", "The service logs each attempt."]
    },
    {
        "name": "UserDatabase",
        "type": "COMPONENT",
        "alternativeNames": ["DB"],
        "occurrences": ["It forwards valid credentials to the UserDatabase.", "The DB then validates the credentials."]
    }
]

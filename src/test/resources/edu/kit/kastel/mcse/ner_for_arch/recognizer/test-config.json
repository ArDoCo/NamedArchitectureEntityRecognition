Component identification:\nIdentify all architecturally relevant software architecture components that are explicitly named in the text (direct mentions).\nFor each, determine the most descriptive name.\n2. Line-by-line analysis:\nFor each line in the text (starting from 1):\nEvery time a previously identified component is mentioned, output: \"<componentName>, <lineNumber>, <referenceType>\"\ncomponentName: The most descriptive name of the component (consistent across all lines).\nlineNumber: Line number where the reference occurs.\nreferenceType: either \"DIRECT\" or \"INDIRECT\".\nDIRECT -> The name or any alternative name of the component appears in the text (case-insensitive).\nINDIRECT -> The component is referenced indirectly (e.g., via pronouns like \"it\", or via \"this module\").\n3. Alternative names:\nAfter analyzing all lines, list alternative or ambiguous names for each component in this format: \"<componentName>: <alternativeName1>, <alternativeName2>, ...\"\n(If there are no alternatives for a component, write \"None\".)\n4. Final consistency check:\nVerify that:\nAll line numbers are accurate.\nAll alternative names are correctly listed.\nDIRECT is used only when the component name or an alternative name appears in the line.\n\nFormatting:\nReturn results in structured plain text as follows:\nBEGIN-OUTPUT\n<componentName>, <lineNumber>, <referenceType>\n...\nAlternative names:\n<componentName>: <alternativeName1>, <alternativeName2>, ...\n...\nEND-OUTPUT\n\nExample:\nText:\nThe AuthenticationService handles login requests.\nIt forwards valid credentials to the UserDatabase.\nThe service logs each attempt.\n\nOutput:\nBEGIN-OUTPUT\nAuthenticationService, 1, DIRECT\nAuthenticationService, 2, INDIRECT\nUserDatabase, 2, DIRECT\nAuthenticationService, 3, INDIRECT\n\nAlternative names:\nAuthenticationService: service\nUserDatabase: None\nEND-OUTPUT\n\n\nUse this exact output format and do not add anything else!",

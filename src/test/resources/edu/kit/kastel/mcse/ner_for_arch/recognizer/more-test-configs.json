For each appearance:\n- The line number (start counting from 1)\n- Whether the appearance is:\n    DIRECT = The name or any alternative name of the component appears literally in the text (case-insensitive)\n    or\n    INDIRECT = The component is referred to indirectly, e.g., by pronouns (\"it\", \"this component\", \"such module\")\n\nRules:\n- Only include actual architecturally relevant components (e.g., modules, services, subsystems, layers)\n- Do not include: interfaces, external libraries, frameworks, or technologies unless they are implemented in this architecture as components\nReturn your findings in a clear, unambiguous, structured text format so that a follow-up transformation into JSON is easy.\n",
